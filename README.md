CI401 Introduction to Programming project 

PROJECT TITLE: Phonebook

PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this project is to transform a basic terminal-based phonebook program into a gui-based phonebook program where users can see the contacts on a table and have the ability to add, delete, edit and search through contacts.

VERSION or DATE: 12/01/2025

HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
1. First unzip the phonebook file so the BlueJ file 'package' can show all the classes.
2. Run the BlueJ project file called 'package'. It's located next to this read me file. 
3. Once you run the package file,  run the JavaFX application of the class called 'Main'.
4. After running the class called 'Main',  it may ask you whether to use JavaFX thread or a separate  thread. Click the button that says 'Use JavaFX thread'.
5. The main class loads up the main view, which allows you to access all the features implemented in the phonebook program.
